## Tech stack

- _Angular9_, as the main framework
- _Angular Material_, for the UI components
- _NGRX_, for the state management
- _Leaflet_, for maps

## Running the app

To run the app locally, first of all run `npm install`to install all the dependencies. Then, run `ng serve` and the application will be available at http://localhost:4200. Make sure you are also running the API in local, which can be done through the `npm run docker`command.

The app is also hosted in Heroku, in the following link: https://wefox-challenge-dof.herokuapp.com/. I was not able to host the API, so in this case we also need to have the API running locally.
